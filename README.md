This is a single user blogging application written using: php, mysql, javascript, jquery, smarty, html and css.

Right now there's still a number of issues I need to or would like to address.

1. Displaying code in a more readable format.
2. Some small bugs with the tag creation on the new post page. 
3. Creating an about page with contact info, github links and whatnot
4. Setting up the jpeg backgrounds as progressive jpegs instead of baseline. So they load more cleanly on slower connections.
5. Making the site degrade gracefully when javascript is disabled.
